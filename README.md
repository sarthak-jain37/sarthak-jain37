Hi, I’m Sarthak Jain 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate interested in building logic-heavy systems,
with a focus on algorithmic problem solving, backend-oriented development,
and game systems.

I’m open to collaborating on software or game development projects that value
clean system design and problem solving.
